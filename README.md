#figure-generation
This repository includes the code and dummy datasets to generate paper-quality figures using ggplot2 in R
I plan to upload a tutorial here for how to make all the major figures in my paper using jupyter notebooks.
I also plan to upload the "dummy datasets" which are pared down versions of the metadata in the published paper, so that you can generate figures in line!

I am a beginner in all of this stuff, but I'd like to make my code open-source, because I found even the dumbest solutions to be very helpful when I was making my figures.  

You can paste the link to this repository in Jupyter Notebook Viewer (https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to see the notebook.
